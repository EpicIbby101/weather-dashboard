// PSEUDOCODE FOR WEATHER APP
// 
// HEADER COMPONENT
// I should have a simple header that says 'Weather Dashboard' against a coloured background
//
// CITY SELECTOR
// I should have a search bar that allows me to search up a city to find the weather forecast
// Beneath the search bar I could have a search history of recently searched cities that is added to whenever a city is searched
//
// CURRENT WEATHER FORECAST
// I need to create a component that calls on the weather API and populates the element with the relevant information and print it on the screen
//
// 5 DAY FORECAST
// For the selected city, I'll also need to present the weather forecast for the following 5 days
// This follows a similar approach to getting the current weather forecast but I'm calling on different API data
